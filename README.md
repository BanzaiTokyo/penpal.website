# penpal.website
Let's build a script to manage a fully functional penpal website where people can find friends exchange messages and share their mail addresses.

My experience as a past penpal webmaster is that the biggest challenge is to make the website easy to use and at the same time keep spammers and scammers away. There is nothing worse than to wait for a message from a real human being and instead to get a bunch of Nigerian princes begging to send you millions.

We are here to build such a website that will be easy to set up and use, that will be as self-managing as possible and engaging for users.
